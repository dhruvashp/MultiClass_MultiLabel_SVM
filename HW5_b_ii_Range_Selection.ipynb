    "\n",
    "We will pick small values and large values (extremely small and extremely large) for C and gamma\n",

    "As such either, or even both could be picked. To make the problem simple, we'll pick the Hamming Loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we'll calculate the hamming errors for each combination. We'll save the errors in a .csv and select then the appropriate range for C and gamma\n",

    "Also, once the results have been obtained, we may write a piece of code that scans through the .csv file with errors and picks the end points for C and gamma\n",
