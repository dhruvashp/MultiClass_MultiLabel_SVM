# MultiClass_MultiLabel_SVM

As the title suggests, the above set of codes performs SVM (as well as K-Means Clustering) on a Multi-Class and Multi-Label Dataset using a varied set of approaches.

This was done as a part of the course DSCI 552, under Prof. Rajati, taken at USC in Fall 2020. The coding was done in Fall 2020 and re-commited to GitHub in a more organized manner around Spring 2021
